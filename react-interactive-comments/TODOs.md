### TODOs

- [x] Update README.md with demo screenshots
- [x] Change `dependencies` to `peerDependencies` in package.json to make the plugin requirement as broad as possible
- [x] Resolve the corejs errors. Sample:

```bash
Bundling react-interactive-comments...
'core-js/modules/es.array.iterator.js' is imported by react-interactive-comments/src/lib/react-interactive-comments.tsx, but could not be resolved â€“ treating it as an external dependency
```
